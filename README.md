### Machine Learning Principles and Concepts: Regression Analysis & Data Engineering

#### Overview

In this assignment, we delve into the conventional machine learning problem of Regression, enriched with a blend of various data engineering techniques. These techniques include management of categorical features, feature engineering, normalization, dimensionality reduction, and more, all applied to a dataset of 205 car models across 25 columns.

#### Dataset

- **Size**: 205 car models
- **Columns**: 25
  - **Target Variable**: Price (last column)
  - **Features**: 24 columns (numerical and categorical)

#### Models Utilized

- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression
- Lasso Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Multilayer Perceptron

Metrics Calculated:
- Mean Squared Error
- Mean Absolute Error
- R-Squared Score

#### Techniques & Tools Applied

1. **Data Engineering Techniques**: Including categorical feature management, feature engineering, normalization, and dimensionality reduction.
2. **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Using Grid Search.
   
#### Key Findings & Results Discussion

- **Best Performing Model**: Random Forest, exhibiting the lowest mean squared error, mean absolute error, and highest R-squared score.
- **Data Standardization Insight**: The Random Forest model maintained superior performance even with standardized data, while the MLP regressor was notably sensitive to data scaling.
- **Dimensionality Reduction Insight**: Models trained on the original dimensional space generally outperformed those trained with PCA, indicating vital information may be lost during dimensionality reduction. However, the Random Forest regressor demonstrated consistency in performance even in reduced dimensional spaces.
