Machine Learning Project - Car Sales Predictions - Regression Models(Python)

We have a dataset that contains prices for 205 car models. The dataset contains 25 columns. The last column contains the price of the model which is the target value. The rest 24 columns represent other numerical and categorical features. 

We have conducted a regression analysis using Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest and Multilayer Perceptron.
We calculated for each of the above regression models the mean squared error, mean absolute error and r squared score.
We applied several data engineering techniques like the management of categorical features, feature engineering, normalization, dimensionality reduction, and so on.
Grid search was used to optimize hyperparameters for machine learning models.
We created graphs comparing the models and the different methods and in the end we selected the best model with the higher performance and computational efficiency(You must download the html file or ipynb to see the project).
